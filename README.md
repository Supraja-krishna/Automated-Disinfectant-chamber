Welcome to the Automated Arduino based Disinfectant chamber project. This project is designed to take effective sanitation measures in public spaces to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. The disinfectant chamber consists of LDRs, servo motors, solenoid lock, blower, UV LEDs, IR sensor at each section to complete the disinfection process effectively. Program code which is compiled in Arduino software, is uploaded in the Arduino Uno microcontroller board. Here we provide the overview of the repositories that belong to our project and are required to build your own disinfectant chamber:
